# Poster Chatter Thingy

Here's a script that will watch Top Hat for any new posts. Once there is a post and it sees it, it will grab what it needs and post it in the chatbox.  
Way this was achieved was I noticed that the rss page...nothing changes so I hashed it with MD5 and conduct the check like that. If there is a difference, obviously something changed and it grabs the post and posts it in chat. 
It also texts me with the new response that way I can get it to my phone. Mainly to use up my twilio credits...   

# Just thoughts on what next to add

Eventually, I will add a function to post on a new member's introduction and welcome them because I'm too lazy to say hi myself. I also suck at hi's.  
Thats it for now
